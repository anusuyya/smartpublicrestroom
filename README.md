## Objectives
- Define clear project objectives and success criteria.
- Enhance public restroom management by reducing wait times and improving cleanliness.
- Provide real-time restroom availability and cleanliness data to the public.

## IoT Sensor System Design
- Select appropriate IoT sensors (e.g., motion, ultrasonic, air quality).
- Determine sensor placement for accurate data collection.
- Choose IoT communication protocols and hardware (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

## Restroom Information Platform
- Develop a user-friendly web/mobile app.
- Display real-time occupancy status and cleanliness ratings.
- Implement user feedback features for issue reporting and cleaning requests.

## Implementation
- Collect data from IoT sensors using Python scripts.
- Transmit sensor data to a central server or cloud platform.
- Process data to determine restroom occupancy and cleanliness.
- Update the platform/mobile app with real-time data.

## Usage
- Users can access real-time restroom information through the platform or mobile app.
- Real-time updates on availability and cleanliness are provided.
- Users can report issues or request cleaning via the app.

## Testing
- Rigorously test the system for accuracy and reliability.
- Optimize occupancy detection and maintenance alert algorithms.
- Address performance or scalability issues.

## Deployment
- Deploy the IoT sensor system in public restrooms.
- Launch the platform/mobile app for public use.
- Monitor system performance in real-world scenarios.

## Maintenance
- Regularly maintain and calibrate IoT sensors.
- Gather user feedback for improvements.
- Keep the platform and mobile app updated with new features and bug fixes.
